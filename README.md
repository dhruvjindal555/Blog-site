# Full Stack Blog Editor with Auto-Save Draft Feature

## Project Overview
This project is a full-stack blog editor application that enables users to write, edit, save drafts, and publish blog posts. It includes an auto-save draft feature to improve user experience and data safety. The app separates published blogs and drafts and supports editing existing posts. It also features protected APIs using JWT authentication and visual notifications for auto-saving.
